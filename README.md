# AutoLongRedditStories
Automate those annoying AI-narrated Reddit stories with minecraft parkour in the background<br/>

Disclaimer: this project is an experiment and is mostly vibe coded

# TODO
- some sort of welcome screen with a "generate topics or I already have an idea" choices
- add tts generation to the loop
- easy install script
- thumbnail generator
- captions generator
- render final video
- folder structure



# But how is this different from [elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot)?

- this is worse
- this uses one long story instead of multiple comments
- the story is AI generated instead of pulled from reddit
- this is worse
