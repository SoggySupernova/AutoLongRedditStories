# AutoLongRedditStories
Automate those annoying AI-narrated Reddit stories with minecraft parkour in the background<br/>

Disclaimer: this project is an experiment and has some AI-generated code



# TODO
- spaces between em dash messes up subtitle alignment
- trim video to audio
- some sort of welcome screen with a "generate topics or I already have an idea" choices
- easy install script
- thumbnail generator
- write documentation



# But how is this different from [elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot)?

- This script uses one long story instead of multiple comments.
- The story is AI generated instead of pulled from Reddit.
- This is fully local after initial model downloading.


# Usage Instructions
1. Read the setup file for your operating system
2. Run main.py and answer the prompts
