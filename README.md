# AutoLongRedditStories
Automate those annoying AI-narrated Reddit stories with minecraft parkour in the background<br/>

Disclaimer: this project is an experiment and has some AI-generated code


# Todo priority
- chattertesting -> chatter
- speed up audio and srt
- fix srt flickering
- fix utf-8 error

# TODO
- some sort of welcome screen with a "generate topics or I already have an idea" choices
- implement script generation
- easy install script
- thumbnail generator



# But how is this different from [elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot)?

- this is worse
- this uses one long story instead of multiple comments
- the story is AI generated instead of pulled from reddit
- this is worse


# Usage Instructions
