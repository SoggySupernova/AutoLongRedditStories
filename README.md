# AutoLongRedditStories
Automate those annoying AI-narrated Reddit stories with minecraft parkour in the background<br/><br>
**Percentage of AI-generated code: ~40%**



# TODO
- some sort of welcome screen with a "generate topics or I already have an idea" choices
- randomize video start point
- fix font needs to be called Monsterrat-Bold
- easy install script
- thumbnail generator
- write documentation



# But how is this different from [elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot)?

- This script uses one long story instead of multiple comments.
- The story is AI generated instead of pulled from Reddit.
- This is fully local after initial model downloading.


# Usage Instructions
